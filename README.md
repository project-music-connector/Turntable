# Turntable

The Turntable (inspired by Avoka's [Dyskograf](https://www.avoka.fr/portfolio/dyskograf/)) is an Arduino-powered turntable for which you can draw your own "vinyls". These drawings on circular discs, detected by infrared sensors, are transformed into looping music.
A Processing code reads the sensor data and interprets it, playing or generating sounds using the Processing 3 Sound library.
